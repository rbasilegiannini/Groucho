# Anche Groucho è un eroe

_Anche Groucho è un eroe_  is a short video game incorporating action and narrative elements, developed in Java for Android. This project was created as part of the university course in Game Design and Development. Inspired by the comic book series Dylan Dog by [Sergio Bonelli Editore](https://www.sergiobonelli.it)  the game was developed without the use of a game engine.

Technologies utilized in its development include:

- The Android framework for graphics;
- [JLiquidFun](https://github.com/mfaella/JLiquidFun) for physics simulation;
- Android Studio as the development environment.

Throughout the development of this video game, it has been crucial to identify and divide the various responsibilities within the system in order to separate the different functionalities (Single Responsibility Principle). In general, a development goal has been to follow the SOLID principles and maintain clean code overall, aiming to produce readable, extendable, and maintainable software.

In addition to using various design patterns (in particular Observer and State), another key aspect of the adopted architecture is the use of the Entity-Component paradigm. This approach has proven particularly suitable for ensuring high modularity and extensibility, in line with the Open/Closed Principle.

The artificial intelligence subsystem consists of using a finite state machine to manage NPC behavior and the AStar algorithm for pathfinding.
